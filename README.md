Project Title: E-Commerce Product Recommendation and Review Prediction System

Problem Statement:
In the rapidly growing e-commerce industry, personalized recommendations and review predictions play a crucial role in enhancing customer experience. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that provides personalized product recommendations based on customer ID using KNN and predicts product review scores based on product ID. By leveraging historical data, the system helps improve customer engagement, boosts sales, and enhances decision-making for both customers and businesses.


Insights from the Data:
Identified trends in customer purchasing behavior based on product categories and ratings.
Detected the impact of review scores on customer purchase decisions.
Discovered correlations between product demand and seasonal trends.
Analyzed sentiment from customer reviews to enhance product recommendations.


📌 Workflow of the Project
1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Storage (Big Data Handling)
Dataset: Historical e-commerce sales data (structured CSV files).
Key Features Used for Review Prediction:
Product ID (to understand product-specific trends).
Price (higher/lower prices influencing ratings).
Freight Value (shipping cost impact on customer satisfaction).
Data Source:
Raw data stored in AWS S3 (Raw Data Bucket).
Used AWS Glue Crawler to catalog and structure data.
Challenge:
Large dataset processing with Pandas was slow.
Solution:
Used AWS Glue & PySpark for distributed processing.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Transformation (ETL & Feature Engineering)
Challenges Faced:
Missing values in freight_value & price.
Some products had skewed review distribution (imbalanced data).
Solution:
AWS Glue ETL pipeline:
Filled missing values using mean imputation for price & freight value.
Removed outliers using IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
Created additional features:
Price-to-Freight Ratio: To capture impact on review scores.
Product Popularity Index: Based on sales frequency.
Processed data stored in AWS S3 (Processed Data Bucket).

SageMaker Workflow
Data Preparation
Source: Processed data is fetched from the AWS S3 bucket (Processed Data Bucket).
Tool: Use Boto3 to interact with S3 for accessing the processed data.
Action: Load data into SageMaker and prepare it for training.
Model Training
Model Selection: Trained models using XGBoost for review prediction.
Tool: Use Boto3 to interact with SageMaker for initiating the training job.
Action:
Boto3 starts the training job with the processed dataset.
Training: Use SageMaker's built-in algorithm for XGBoost and specify hyperparameters.
Hyperparameter Tuning
Tuning: Used SageMaker's automatic hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
Tool: Boto3 was used to start and monitor the hyperparameter tuning job.
Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.
Tool: Use Boto3 to track model performance and retrieve the best model based on evaluation metrics.
Model Deployment
Model Saving: After training, the XGBoost model was saved as a .pkl file in an S3 bucket.
3️⃣ Machine Learning Pipeline (Model Training & Optimization)
Task 1: Review Prediction (Classifying customer review ratings)
Models Tested:
Logistic Regression: Poor accuracy (~60%) due to high bias.
Decision Tree: Overfit on training data (~70% accuracy but poor generalization).
Random Forest: Improved accuracy (~78%) but computationally expensive.
XGBoost (Final Model): Best performance (~85% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning).
Training Process:
Used AWS SageMaker for training & hyperparameter tuning.
Stored XGBoost trained model as a .pkl file in AWS S3.
Why XGBoost?
Handles missing data efficiently.
Performs well on tabular structured data.
Optimized training speed with AWS SageMaker tuning.

4️⃣ Product Recommendation (KNN-Based Approach)
Challenge:
Collaborative filtering didn’t work well due to sparse data.
Solution:
Used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for recommendations.
Personalized Recommendation: Suggested products based on purchase patterns.
Hybrid Approach: Combined price, product_id, and review prediction score for better recommendations.
Performance Optimization:
Stored recommendation results in AWS S3 (Processed Data Bucket).

5️⃣ Deployment & Cloud-Based Automation
Deployment Workflow:
No Docker Used.
Uploaded trained XGBoost & KNN models to AWS S3.
Streamlit-based Web App for User Interaction.
EC2 Deployment:
Launched AWS EC2 instance.
Installed dependencies using requirements.txt.
Hosted the Streamlit app for live predictions.
Challenges Faced & Solutions:
Issue: Model inference was slow.
Solution: Optimized EC2 instance selection and used efficient model loading.

6️⃣ Data Visualization & Insights (Power BI)
Challenge:
Direct Power BI connection to AWS S3 was complex.
Solution:
Used AWS Athena to query S3 data and connected Power BI via DirectQuery.
Built interactive dashboards showcasing:
Review Prediction Analysis (Predicted vs. Actual Ratings).
Product Recommendation Insights (Most recommended products by category).
E-commerce Sales Trends (Revenue, most sold products).
